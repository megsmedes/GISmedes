## Best Places to Live

### Maps can be used for planning purposes, including personal ones like best places to live. Suitability maps use several criteria to narrow down a location.  In this instance, I wanted to find out the best places to live south of L.A. I wanted a place with a good view, walking/hiking trails, other families in the neighborhood, and the least amount of traffic incidents.  The neighborhood that had all 4 criteria was Yorba Linda.
