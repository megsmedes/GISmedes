# Recreation Maps

## Cost Distance Modeling of Scenic Byways in SW Colorado
	
### If you would like to bike through southern Colorado, this map shows 3 routes on Scenic Byways from Carbondale to Cortez.  The first route shows the least cost or the shortest distance and least amount of time to travel between these destinations.  It also happens to be the route with more gradual climbs up the mountainous slopes.  Catch your breathe on the second route, the path with lower elevations. Altitude can be rough so breathe easier on this detour.  It also passes close to Montrose for bikers who need a pit stop. For an extra challenge, take the steepest path.  The path with steepest slopes also traverses the Alpine Loop, appropriately named as it is above treeline, over 11,000 feet in elevation.

> All paths were determined using the average biker speed of 16 miles per hour.  The path of least resistance is 244 miles.  A biker should plan at least 15 hours to ride and may choose to spend the night in a town along the way or under the stars!

## Butterfly and Moth Spottings Near Trails

> In this map, I used inaturalist data to plot butterfly and moth, lepidoptera, sitings in Jefferson County.  The bottom map takes a closer look at Lair o' the Bear Open Space Park.
