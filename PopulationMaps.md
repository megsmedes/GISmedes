>This map explores how many people in Navajo Nation are vulnerable to drinking contaminated well water.  The map is part of a larger in depth Earth Data Science analysis of the water quality on the DinÃ© (Navajo) Reservation following the Gold King Mine Spill of 2017. I participated in the research and created this reproducible science website of the study. In an effort to contribute to reproducible science, the website shares code that others could borrow for a similar project.
