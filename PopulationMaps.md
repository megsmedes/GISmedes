[![Vulnerable Dine Populations Near Well Contamination](https://github.com/megsmedes/GISmedes/blob/main/img/VulPops.png?raw=true)](https://cu-esiil-edu.github.io/MSUDenver-DineWaterQuality2023/water-accessibility.html)
>This map explores the percent of people in Navajo Nation vulnerable to drinking contaminated well water.  The map is part of a larger in-depth Earth Data Science analysis of the <a href="https://cu-esiil-edu.github.io/MSUDenver-DineWaterQuality2023/">water quality on the Din√© (Navajo) Reservation</a> following the Gold King Mine Spill of 2017. I participated in the research and created the reproducible science website of the study. In an effort to contribute to reproducible science, the website shares code that others could borrow for a similar project.
