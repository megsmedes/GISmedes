# About Meghan Smedes

### I love spending time outside, hiking and gardening.  I enjoy sharing stories about nature that inspire and promote a healthier environment.  I am a Geoghraphic Information Systems (GIS) Analyst looking for a career that combines Natural Resource Management with GIS and/or Earth Data Science (EDS).  I earned a Certificate in GIS from Metropolitan State University in 2023.  This pairs nicely with my Bachelor of Science degree in Natural Resource Recreation adn Tourism with a Concentration in Parks and Protected Areas Management from Colorado State University.  Before telling nature's stories through maps, I taught in parks, nature centers and museums.  You can view more about my career at LinkedIn.
