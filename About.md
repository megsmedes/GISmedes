# About Meghan Smedes

### I enjoy sharing stories about nature that inspire and promote a healthier environment.  I am a Geoghraphic Information Systems (GIS) Analyst looking for a career that combines Natural Resource Management with GIS and/or Earth Data Science (EDS).  I earned a Certificate in GIS from Metropolitan State University in 2023.  This pairs nicely with my Bachelor of Science degree in Natural Resource Recreation and Tourism with a Concentration in Parks and Protected Areas Management from Colorado State University.  Before telling nature's stories through maps, I taught in parks, nature centers and museums.

### In my free time, you can find me hiking, traveling, collecting native seeds, planting native gardens, and doing all things "plants."  Here is a website I made about <a href="https://megsmedes.github.io/lab601.html" title ="Making Tea from the Garden">Making Tea from the Garden.</a>
